And alongside, we also were able to catch brand new takes of the Yeezy 500 as well as the quarantine-ready slides, but even though both were enjoyed for their own unique merits, many have their eyes set on the forthcoming offerings which include even more 350s as well as the much newer Yeezy Boost 380.</p>
