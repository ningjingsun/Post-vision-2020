                    <p>As one of the representatives of local manufacturers, Toyota has announced new products for the event. One of the most interesting is the Field Support Robot in the above picture. It looks a lot like a small e-Palette, which is used to transport javelin, shot put and other game equipment in the throwing game. Of course, the actual action of picking up the appliance is still done by people, but the presence of the robot can help reduce the manpower on the field.</p>

					<p>Today Tesla launches its first robotaxis as part of a broader vision for an autonomous ride-sharing network. Tesla will enable owners to add their properly equipped vehicles to its own ride-sharing app, which will have a similar business model to Uber or Airbnb. Tesla will take 25 percent to 30 percent of the revenue. In places where there aren’t enough people to share their cars, Tesla would provide a dedicated fleet of robotaxis.</p>
