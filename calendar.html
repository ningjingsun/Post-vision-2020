Named after the Egyptian god Apophis the Great Serpent, the asteroid is almost as tall as the Empire State Building in New York.

The indigo hue brings to mind both the constant and the classic; the sky at dusk, an impeccably tailored suit, serene waters, or a bowl of perfectly ripe blueberries. The hue embodies a forward-thinking mood and an almost utopian optimism that communicates originality, ingenuity and visionary thinking that points us toward the bright future. </p>

    				<p>Now that 2020 has finally begun, we’ve been met with a number of releases from adidas Yeezy. While they opened up the year with the YZY QNTM at All-Star Weekend, the imprint was quick to revert back to their usual cadence, dropping pairs of the Yeezy Boost 350 v2 near constantly for the better part of a couple months. And alongside, we also were able to catch brand new takes of the Yeezy 500 as well as the quarantine-ready slides, but even though both were enjoyed for their own unique merits, many have their eyes set on the forthcoming offerings which include even more 350s as well as the much newer Yeezy Boost 380.</p>

    				<p>Toyota’s robot in the Olympics : Anyone can guess that the robot will play a very important role in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. As one of the representatives of local manufacturers, Toyota has announced new products for the event. One of the most interesting is the Field Support Robot in the above picture. It looks a lot like a small e-Palette, which is used to transport javelin, shot put and other game equipment in the throwing game. Of course, the actual action of picking up the appliance is still done by people, but the presence of the robot can help reduce the manpower on the field.</p>

    				<p>Today, Chang’e 5, which is China’s most audacious lunar mission so far, is launched into the extraterrestrial world. A lander will attempt to collect nearly 4.5 pounds of moon rocks and dust from the western edge of the near side of the moon. If successful, it will be the first lunar sample return since the Soviet Union’s 1976 Luna 24 mission.

					<p>Today Tesla launches its first robotaxis as part of a broader vision for an autonomous ride-sharing network, CEO Elon Musk said during the company’s Autonomy Day. Tesla will enable owners to add their properly equipped vehicles to its own ride-sharing app, which will have a similar business model to Uber  or Airbnb . Tesla will take 25 percent to 30 percent of the revenue from those rides, Musk said. In places where there aren’t enough people to share their cars, Tesla would provide a dedicated fleet of robotaxis.</p>
